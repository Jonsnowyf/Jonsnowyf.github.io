                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a full-time Research Assistant
                    in Economics at the University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.utaschoenberg.com/" target="_blank"> Professor Uta Sch√∂nberg</a>, Co-Editor of American Economic Review. My research interests span labor economics, immigration, international trade, and general equilibrium applications.</p>
                <p>With a strong foundation in economic research and a passion for exploring complex economic phenomena, I am actively preparing to pursue a PhD in Economics. My goal is to contribute meaningful insights to the field and address pressing economic challenges through rigorous academic research.</p>

                        <h4>A General Equilibrium Model for Inventories <a href="paper_inventory.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a></h4>
                        <p>Abstract: This paper develops a multi-country, multi-sector production network model incorporating firms' inventory holdings for intermediate and final goods. By fully endogenizing inventory decisions, the model uncovers a unique propagation mechanism for global shocks distinct from international trade channels, while demonstrating isomorphism to other multi-sector models with input-output linkages under certain constraints.</p>

                        <h4>Revisiting Fixed Production Costs: A Modified Micro-to-Macro Model in Multinational Production</h4>
                        <p>Abstract: This paper extends the Costinot et al. (2020) framework to incorporate multinational production and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), developing a comprehensive model for n countries that determines optimal production locations based on blueprint technology. The analysis provides new insights into the interactions between consumption taxation, production subsidies, and the dynamics of international trade and FDI flows.</p>

                        <h4>Tax Competition, Endogenous Taxation and Business Environment</h4>
                        <p>Abstract: This thesis extends the Zodrow-Mieszkowski-Wilson (ZMW) model of tax competition by incorporating a transitional corporation and endogenous business environment. The analysis develops static and dynamic models that provide insights into strategic interactions between governments and firms, considering credibility in policy-making and predicting the existence of Nash equilibria under certain conditions.</p>
